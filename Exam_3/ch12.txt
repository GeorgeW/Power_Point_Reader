GENE EXPRESSION 
The Central Dogma 


A Protein is a high molecular weight, nitrogen-containing organic compound of complex shape and composition.  
It consists of one or more chains macromolecular subunits called  a polypeptide, which are made of smaller building blocks called amino acids. 
A polypeptide is encoded by a gene. 
The synthesis of functional proteins determines an organisms traits 
Crick gave us the name  
“The Central Dogma of Genetics”-  
path from gene to trait 
  
Only one strand of the DNA molecule is transcribed into a molecule of RNA. 

------------------------------
Slide 4
The Central Dogma of Genetics 


DNA replication:  
makes DNA copies that are transmitted from cell and from parent to offspring. 
Chromosomal DNA: stores information in units called genes. 
Transcription:  
produces an RNA copy of gene. 
Messenger RNA: a temporary copy of a gene that contains information to make a polypeptide. 
Translation:  
produces a polypeptide using the information in mRNA. 
Polypeptide: becomes part of a functional protein that contributes to an organism’s traits. 
[img4]
------------------------------
Slide 5
Introduction 


At the molecular level, a  
gene 
 is a segment of DNA used to make a functional product 
either an RNA or a polypeptide 
Transcription 
 is the first step in gene expression 
[img5]
------------------------------
Slide 6
Transcription 


Transcription literally means the act or process of making a copy 
In genetics, the term refers to the copying of a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence  
The structure of DNA is not altered as a result of this process 
It can continue to store information 
[img6]

Associate with each  
gene are Gene  
Regulatory Elements, 
which are involved  
in transcriptional  
regulation.

12.1 Overview of Transcription 


A key concept is that DNA base sequences define the beginning and end of a gene and regulate the level of RNA synthesis 
Another important concept is that proteins must recognize and act on DNA for transcription to occur 
Gene expression is the overall process by which the information within a gene is used to produce a functional product which can, in concert with environmental factors, determine a trait 
Common organization of a bacterial gene: 
[img9]
------------------------------
Slide 10
Organization of sequences of a bacterial gene and its mRNA transcript (2 of 3) 


DNA: 
Regulatory sequences:  
site for the binding of regulatory proteins; the role of regulatory proteins is to influence the rate of transcription. Regulatory sequences can be found in a variety of locations. 
Promoter:  
site for RNA polymerase binding; signals the beginning of transcription. 
Terminator:  
signals the end of transcription. 
mRNA 
Ribosome-binding site:  
site for ribosome binding; translation begins near this site in the mRNA. In eukaryotes, the ribosome scans the mRNA for a start codon. 
[img10]
------------------------------
Slide 11
Organization of sequences of a bacterial gene and its mRNA transcript 


Start codon 
: specifies the first amino acid in a polypeptide sequence, usually a formylmethionine (in bacteria) or a methionine (in eukaryotes). 
Codons:  
3 nucleotide sequences within the mRNA that specify particular amino acids. The sequence of codons within mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids within a polypeptide. 
Stop codon:  
specifies the end of polypeptide synthesis. 
Bacterial mRNA may be  
polycistronic 
, which means it encodes two or more polypeptides. 
[img11]
------------------------------
Slide 12
Gene Expression Requires Base Sequences 


The DNA strand that is actually transcribed (used as the template) is termed the  
template strand 
The RNA transcript is complementary to the template strand 
The opposite strand is called the  
coding strand  
or the  
sense strand 
 as well as the  
nontemplate 
 strand 
The base sequence is identical to the RNA transcript 
Except for the substitution of uracil in RNA for thymine in DNA 
[img12]
------------------------------
Slide 13
Gene Expression Requires Base Sequences 


Transcription factors  
recognize the promoter and regulatory sequences to control transcription 

------------------------------
Slide 14
Gene Expression Requires Base Sequences 


mRNA sequences such as the  
ribosomal-binding site  
and  
codons 
 direct  
translation 

------------------------------
Slide 15
Stages of Transcription (1 of 3) 


Transcription occurs in three stages 
Initiation 
Elongation 
Termination 
These steps involve protein-DNA interactions 
Proteins such as RNA polymerase interact with DNA sequences 
[img15]
------------------------------
[img16]Slide 16
Stages of Transcription (3 of 3) 


Initiation:  
The promoter functions as a recognition site for transcription factors (not shown). The transcription factors enable RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter. Following binding, the DNA is denatured into a bubble known as the open complex. 
Elongation/synthesis of the RNA transcript:  
RNA polymerase slides along the DNA in an open complex to synthesize RNA. 
Termination:  
A terminator is reached that causes RNA polymerase and the RNA transcript to dissociate from the DNA. 

------------------------------
Slide 17
There are four different types of RNA molecules, each encoded by its own type of gene 


mRNA  
(messenger RNA) encodes the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. 
tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids to ribosomes during translation. 
rRNA (ribosomal RNA), with ribosomal proteins, makes up the ribosome. 
Other forms of non-coding RNA: microRNA (miRNA), short non-coding RNA (snRNA), ;long non-coding RNA and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). 

------------------------------
Slide 18
RNA Transcripts have Different Functions (1 of 2) 


Once they are made, RNA transcripts play different functional roles 
Well over 90% of all genes are structural genes which are transcribed into mRNA 
Final functional products are polypeptides 
The other RNA molecules in Table 12.1 are never translated 
Final functional products are RNA molecules 

------------------------------
Slide 19
RNA Transcripts have Different Functions (2 of 2) 


The RNA transcripts from nonstructural genes are not translated 
They do have various important cellular functions 
They can still confer traits 
In some cases, the RNA transcript becomes part of a complex that contains protein subunits 
For example 
Ribosomes 
Spliceosomes 
Signal recognition particles 
Telomerase 

------------------------------
Slide 20
12.2 Transcription in Bacteria 


Our molecular understanding of gene transcription came from studies involving bacteria and bacteriophages 
Indeed, much of our knowledge comes from studies of a single bacterium 
E. coli 
, of course 
In this section we will examine the three steps of transcription as they occur in bacteria 

------------------------------
Slide 21
Promoters 


Promoters 
 are DNA sequences that “promote” gene expression 
More precisely, they direct the exact location for the initiation of transcription 
Promoters are typically located just upstream of the site where transcription of a gene actually begins 
The bases in a promoter sequence are numbered in relation to the transcription start site 
[img21]
------------------------------
Slide 22
Examples of -35 and -10 Sequences in  
Promotors 
  
[img22]
------------------------------
Slide 23
Initiation of Bacterial Transcription (1 of 2) 


RNA polymerase  
is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of RNA 
In E. coli, the RNA polymerase  
holoenzyme 
 is composed of 
Core enzyme 
Five subunits =  
α 
2 
ββ 
’ 
 
Sigma factor 
One subunit =  
σ 
These subunits play distinct functional roles 
[img23]
------------------------------
Slide 24
Initiation of Bacterial Transcription 


The RNA polymerase  
holoenzyme 
 binds loosely to the DNA 
It then scans along the DNA, until it encounters a promoter region 
When it does, the sigma factor recognizes both the –35 and –10 regions 
A region within the sigma factor that contains a  
helix-turn-helix structure  
is involved in a tighter binding to the DNA 
[img24]
------------------------------
Slide 25
Binding of Sigma Factor Protein to DNA Double Helix 
[img25]
------------------------------
Slide 26
Transcription Initiation 


The binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter forms the  
closed complex 
Then, the  
open complex  
is formed when the TATAAT box in the -10 region is unwound 
A-T bonds are more easily separated 
A short RNA strand is made within the open complex 
The sigma factor is released at this point 
This marks the end of initiation 
The core enzyme now slides down the DNA to synthesize an RNA strand 
This is known as the elongation phase 
[img26]
------------------------------
Slide 27
The Initiation Stage of Transcription in Bacteria 
[img27]
------------------------------
Slide 28
Elongation in Bacterial Transcription (1 of 2) 


The RNA transcript is synthesized during the elongation stage 
The DNA strand used as a template for RNA synthesis is termed the  
template 
 or  
antisense strand 
The opposite DNA strand is called the  
coding strand 
It has the same base sequence as the RNA transcript 
Except that T in DNA corresponds to U in RNA 
[img28]
------------------------------
Slide 29
Elongation in Bacterial Transcription (2 of 2) 


The open complex formed by the action of RNA polymerase is about 17 bases long 
Behind the open complex, the DNA rewinds back into a double helix 
On average, the rate of RNA synthesis is about 43 nucleotides per second! 
Figure 12.8 depicts the key points in the synthesis of an RNA transcript  
[img29]
------------------------------
Slide 30
Synthesis of the RNA transcript 


Key Points: 
RNA polymerase slides along the DNA, creating an open complex as it moves. 
The DNA strand known as the template strand is used to make a complementary copy of RNA, resulting in an RNA-DNA hybrid. 
RNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3’ to 5’ direction, and RNA is synthesized in a 5’ to 3’ direction using nucleoside triphosphates as precursors. Pyrophosphate is released (not shown). 
The complementary rule is the same as the AT/GC rule except that U is substituted for T in the RNA. 

------------------------------
Slide 31
Both strands of Genomic DNA are used as Template Strand for Different Genes 
[img31]
------------------------------
Slide 32
Termination of Bacterial Transcription 


Termination 
 is the end of RNA synthesis 
It occurs when the short RNA-DNA hybrid of the open complex is forced to separate 
This releases the newly made RNA as well as the RNA polymerase 
E. coli has two different mechanisms for termination 
rho-dependent termination 
Requires a protein known as  
r 
 (rho) 
rho-independent termination 
Does not require  
r 

------------------------------
Slide 33
rho Dependent Termination 
[img33]
------------------------------
Slide 34
rho Independent Termination 


ρ 
-independent termination  
is facilitated by two sequences in the RNA 
A uracil-rich sequence located at the 3’ end of the RNA 
A stem-loop structure upstream of the uracil-rich sequence 
[img34][img34]
------------------------------
Slide 35
12.3 Transcription in Eukaryotes 


Many of the basic features of gene transcription are very similar in bacteria and eukaryotes 
However, gene transcription in eukaryotes is more complex 
Larger, more complex cells (organelles) 
Added cellular complexity means more genes that encode proteins are required  
Multicellularity 
 adds another level of regulation 
express genes only in the correct cells at the proper time 

------------------------------
Slide 36
Properties of Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases 




Prokaryotes have one type of  
polymerase that is used to transcribe structural genes and the 
genes for tRNA and rRNA.  Below, is a 3D image of RNA polymerase from yeast. 
[img36]
------------------------------
Slide 37
Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases (2 of 2) 


All three are very similar structurally and are composed of many subunits 
There is also a remarkable similarity between the bacterial RNA pol and its eukaryotic counterparts

A Common Pattern of the Promoter for Protein Encoding Genes 


The core promoter is relatively short 
It consists of the TATA box and transcriptional start site 
Important in determining the precise start point for transcription 
The core promoter by itself produces a low level of transcription 
This is termed  
basal transcription

Slide 42
Sequences of Eukaryotic Structural Genes (2 of 2)

RNA polymerase II:  
The enzyme that catalyses the linkage of nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction, using DNA as a template. Most eukaryotic RNA polymerase II proteins are composed of 12 subunits. The two largest subunits are structurally similar to the β and β′ subunits found in  
E. coli 
 RNA polymerase.

Slide 45
Table 12.1 (4 of 4) 


Mediator:  
A  
multisubunit 
 complex that mediates the effects of regulatory transcription factors on the function of RNA polymerase II. Though mediator typically has certain core subunits, many of its subunits vary, depending on the cell type and environmental conditions. The ability of mediator to affect the function of RNA polymerase II is thought to occur via the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Mediator can influence the ability of TFIIH to phosphorylate CTD, and subunits within mediator itself have the ability to phosphorylate CTD. Because CTD phosphorylation is needed to release RNA polymerase II from TFIIB, mediator plays a key role in the ability of RNA polymerase II to switch from the initiation to the elongation stage of transcription. 
[img45]
------------------------------
Slide 46
Accurate initiation of Transcription of a protein-coding gene involves the assembly of RNA pol II and a number of other proteins called  
basal (General) transcription factors 
 (TFs) 


All three eukaryotic polymerases require TFs. 
The TFs and their respective RNA polymerase come together to form an  
initiation complex. 
The initiation complex is sufficient for only a low level of transcription. 
For higher levels of transcription, other transcription factors called  
activators 
 will control which promoters are transcribed actively. 
Activators 
 bind to regulator elements in the DNA called  
enhancers 
. 
Enhancers  
are needed for maximum transcription. 

------------------------------
Slide 47
Factors Affecting Transcription 


Regulatory elements are short DNA sequences that affect the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter  
Transcription factors (proteins) bind to these elements and influence the rate of transcription 
They are two types of regulatory elements 
Enhancers 
Stimulate transcription 
Silencers 
Inhibit transcription 
They vary widely in their locations but are often found in the  
	–50 to –100 region 

------------------------------
Slide 48
Enhancers 


Enhancer 
 elements (DNA sequences) are found singly or in multiple copies. 
Function in either orientation, either upstream, downstream or in the gene itself.  In most cases they are located upstream. 
Can be thousands of base pairs from the gene. 
Function in Combinations with other enhancer elements. 
The opposite to enhancers are  
silencers. 
[img48]
------------------------------
Slide 49
Silencers 


Silencer 
 elements (DNA sequence) have similar properties to enhancers, except that they repress gene activation. 
Are much less common than enhancers. 
The transcription factors that bind them are called  
repressors. 
[img49]
------------------------------
Slide 50
RNA Polymerase II and its Transcription Factors 


Three categories of proteins are required for basal transcription to occur at the promoter 
RNA polymerase II 
Five different proteins called  
general transcription factors (GTFs)

------------------------------
Slide 53
RNA Polymerase II and its Transcription Factors 


Mediator may phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II and it may regulate the ability of TFIIH to phosphorylate the CTD 
Therefore it plays a pivotal role in the switch between transcriptional initiation and elongation

Slide 55
RNA Pol II Transcriptional Termination 


Pre-mRNAs are modified by cleavage near their 3’ end with subsequent attachment of a string of adenines 
Transcription terminates 500 to 2000 nucleotides downstream from the  
polyA 
 signal 
There are two models for termination 
Further research is needed to determine if either, or both are correct 
[img55]
------------------------------
Slide 56
12.4 RNA Modification 


Analysis of bacterial genes in the 1960s and 1970 revealed the following: 
The sequence of DNA in the coding strand corresponds to the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA 
The sequence of codons in the mRNA provides the instructions for the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide 
This is termed the  
colinearity 
 of gene expression 
Analysis of eukaryotic structural genes in the late 1970s revealed that they are not always colinear with their functional mRNAs

Modification of Eukaryotic RNA transcripts 







------------------------------
Slide 59
RNA Modification (2 of 2) 


In Eukaryotes, RNA transcripts can be modified in several ways 
For example 
Processing of rRNA and tRNA transcripts to smaller functional pieces 
5’ Capping and 3’  
polyA 
 tailing of mRNA transcripts 
RNA Splicing 
[img59]
------------------------------
Slide 60
Eukaryotic Pre-mRNAs have a 5′ Cap and a 3′ Tail 


Most mature mRNAs have a 7-methylguanosine covalently attached at their 5’ end 
This event is known as  
capping 
Capping occurs as the pre-mRNA is being synthesized by RNA pol II 
Usually when the transcript is only 20 to 25 bases long 
As shown in Figure 12.23, capping is a three-step process 

------------------------------
Slide 61

The Role of the 5’ Cap 


The 7-methylguanosine cap structure is recognized by cap-binding proteins 
Cap-binding proteins play roles in the 
Movement of some RNAs into the cytoplasm 
Early stages of translation 
Splicing of introns 

------------------------------
Slide 64
Polyadenylation 
  


Most mature mRNAs have a string of adenine nucleotides at their 3’ ends 
This is termed the  
polyA 
 tail 
The  
polyA 
 tail is not encoded in the gene sequence 
It is added enzymatically after the gene is completely transcribed 
The attachment of the  
polyA 
 tail is shown in Figure 12.24 

------------------------------
Slide 65
Polyadenylation 
 Signal Sequence  
[img65]
------------------------------
Slide 66
Poly (A) tail addition to 3’ end of mRNA 


50 to 250 adenine nucleotides are added to 3' end. 
No template is used for addition of poly(A) tail. 
Poly (A) tail is found on most mRNA, however, histone mRNA does not have the tail. 
The poly(A) tail signals that this is the 3' end and maintains stability of mRNA by protecting it from degradation.

Purpose of slide is for you to know that poly A is not 
encoded by the gene. You need to know about the signal 
for poly A addition, but not the complex. 

------------------------------
Slide 68
Splicing: Processing of mRNA to mature mRNA by Removal of introns 


Most protein-coding  genes have non-amino acid coding sequences called introns (intervening sequence) found between exons (expressed sequences) 
Exons include the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as the  amino acid-coding portions. 
Introns are removed in a process called  
mRNA splicing 
Exons are connected together or spliced 
It is a common genetic phenomenon in eukaryotes 
Occurs occasionally in bacteria as well 

------------------------------
Slide 69
RNA Processing 


Many nonstructural genes are initially transcribed as a large RNA 
This large RNA transcript is enzymatically cleaved into smaller functional pieces 
[img69]
------------------------------
Slide 70
Different Splicing Mechanisms Remove Introns 


Three different splicing mechanisms have been identified 
Group I intron splicing 
Group II intron splicing 
Spliceosome 
All three cases involve  
Removal of the intron RNA  
Linkage of the exon RNA by a  
phosphodiester 
 bond 

------------------------------
Slide 71
Self-Splicing 


Splicing among group I and II introns is termed  
self-splicing 
Splicing does not require the aid of enzymes 
Instead the RNA itself functions as its own ribozyme 
Group I and II differ in the way that the intron is removed and the exons connected 
Refer to Figure 12.18 
Group I and II self-splicing can occur in vitro without the additional proteins 
However, in vivo, proteins known as  
maturases 
 often enhance the rate of splicing 

------------------------------
Slide 72
Mechanisms of RNA Splicing (1 of 3)  


Group I and II are self-splicing 
Group I splicing involves binding of a free  
guanosine 
 to a site within the intron- leads to cleavage at 3’ end of exon 1 
Then bond between different nucleotide in the intron and the 5’ end of exon 2 is cleaved 
The 3’ end of exon 1 then forms a covalent bond with the 5’ end of exon 
Group II self splicing is similar except that the 2’ OH group in adenosine begins catalytic process. 
Pre-mRNA splicing requires the aid of structure known as  
spliceosome

Slide 75
Pre-mRNA Splicing Occurs by the Action of a  
Spliceosome 
 (1 of 2) 


In eukaryotes, the transcription of structural genes produces a long transcript known as a  
pre-mRNA 
This RNA is altered by splicing and other modifications, before it leaves the nucleus 
Splicing requires the aid of a multicomponent structure known as the  
spliceosome 
It is composed of several subunits known as  
snRNPs 
 (pronounced “ 
snurps 
”) 
Each  
snRNP

------------------------------
Slide 76
Pre-mRNA Splicing Occurs by the Action of a  
Spliceosome 
 (2 of 2) 


The subunits of a  
spliceosome 
 carry out several functions 
Bind to an intron sequence and precisely recognize the intron-exon boundaries 
Hold the pre-mRNA in the correct configuration 
Catalyze the chemical reactions that remove introns and covalently link exons

Slide 80
RNA Processing (2 of 2)  


Transfer RNAs are also made as large precursors 
These have to be cleaved at both the 5’ and 3’ ends to produce mature, functional  
tRNAs 
Cleaved by  
exonuclease 
 and endonuclease 
exonucleases 
  
cleave a covalent bond between two nucleotides at one end of a strand 
endonucleases 
 can cleave bonds within a strand 
Figure 12.17 shows the trimming of a precursor  
tRNA 
  
Interestingly, the cleavage occurs differently at the 5’ end and the 3’ end

Consensus Sequences for Pre-mRNA Splicing  


Intron RNA is defined by particular sequences within the intron and at the intron-exon boundaries

Slide 86
Alternative Splicing (1 of 3) 


Alternative splicing allows different polypeptides to be made from the same gene 
One benefit of genes with introns is a phenomenon called  
alternative splicing 
A pre-mRNA with multiple introns can be spliced in different ways 
This will generate mature mRNAs with different combinations of exons 
Two (or more) polypeptides can be derived from a single gene 
This allows an organism to carry fewer genes in its genome 

------------------------------
Slide 87
Alternative Splicing (2 of 3) 


This variation in splicing can occur in different cell types or during different stages of development 
Degree of splicing and alternative splicing varies greatly among different species 
Baker’s yeast:  
~ 6300 genes, ~ 300 encode pre-mRNAs that are spliced  
only a few have been shown to be alternatively spliced 
Humans: ~  
22,000 protein-encoding genes, most contain one or more introns 
Estimates suggest ~ 70% are alternatively spliced 
DSCAM (21q22.2, Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) holds the record for number of isoforms approximately 38,016 isoforms 

------------------------------
Slide 88
Alternative Splicing (3 of 3) 


Constitutive exons  
are always found in the mature mRNA from all cell types 
encode polypeptide segments that are necessary for its general structure and function 
Other exons, called  
alternative exons  
vary from one cell type to another 
subtly change the function of the protein to meet the needs of the cell type in which it is found 
Regulated by  
splicing factors 
Such as  
SR proteins

RNA Editing 


RNA editing involves the posttranscriptional insertion or deletion of nucleotides or the conversion of one base to another. 
First discovered in the 1980s in the protozoa called trypanosome.  Affects some mitochondrial mRNAs as well. 
Found that the DNA sequences did not match the mRNA sequences they were encoding. 
Since this discovery, other types of RNA editing have been found in other organisms including mammals. 
In mammals, RNA editing (C-to-U) results in the tissue-specific generation of a stop codon for the apolipoprotein B,  A-to-G RNA editing in the glutamate receptor and pyrimidine editing in a number of tRNAs.

RNA Editing (1 of 2)  


Change in the nucleotide sequence of an RNA 
Can involve addition or deletion of particular bases 
Can also occur through conversion of a base 
First discovered in trypanosomes 
Now known to occur in many organisms 
Refer to Table 12.5 for a list of examples

Slide 95
RNA Editing (2 of 2) 


RNA editing can occur by changing one type of base to another 
Deamination converts RNA nucleotides to new forms
