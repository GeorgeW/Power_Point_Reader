Introduction 


DNA replication is the process by which the genetic material is copied 
The original DNA strands are used as templates for the synthesis of new strands with identical sequence 
It occurs very quickly, very accurately and at the appropriate time in the life of the cell 
[img3][img3]
------------------------------
Slide 4
11.1 Structural Overview of DNA Replication (1 of 2) 


DNA replication relies on the complementarity of DNA strands 
A pairs with T and G pairs with C 
The AT/GC rule or Chargaff’s rule 
The process is: 
The two complementary DNA strands come apart  
Each serves as a template strand for the synthesis of new complementary DNA strands 
The two newly-made DNA strands =  
daughter strands 
The two original DNA strands =  
parental strands

(a) The mechanism of DNA Replication 

------------------------------
Slide 6
Watson and Crick reasoned that replication would be straight forward if their model was correct. 


They suggested the  
semiconservative 
  
model 
 for DNA replication: 
Two progeny DNA double helices:  Each helix has one new strand and one parental strand and the parental strand acts as the template for the new strand. 

------------------------------
Slide 7
Experiment 11A: Which Model of DNA Replication is Correct?  


In the late 1950s, three different mechanisms were proposed for the replication of DNA 
Conservative model 
Both parental strands stay together after DNA replication 
Semiconservative model 
The double-stranded DNA contains one parental and one daughter strand following replication 
Dispersive model 
Parental and daughter DNA segments are interspersed in both strands following replication

Slide 9
Experiment 11A: Which Model of DNA Replication is Correct?  


In 1958, Matthew  
Meselson 
 and Franklin Stahl devised a method to investigate these models 
They found a way to experimentally distinguish between daughter and parental strands 
Hypothesis 
: Based on Watson’s and Crick’s ideas, the hypothesis was that DNA replication is  
semiconservative 
.

Slide 17
Enzymes Involved in DNA synthesis 


Critical component for synthesis was the  
E. coli 
 lysate:  Kornberg fractionated the lysate and isolated the enzyme  
DNA Polymerase I. 
Four components are needed for DNA  polymerase activity: 
All four dNTPs 
Magnesium ions (Mg

Slide 21
Genetic studies indicated that DNA Pol I was not the only polymerase in  
E. coli. 


Genetic studies that discovered the existence of other DNA polymerases. 
A mutation that made a defective DNA pol I (lacked polymerase activity but had near normal 5’ - 3’ exonuclease activity) was found not to be lethal in  
E. coli. 
Conditional mutants (Temperature-sensitive for 5’-3’ exonuclease activity in DNA Pol I): 
At 37 
o 
C => Temp-sensitive worked normally. 
At 42 
o 
C=>Although DNA Polymerase activity was normal, mutants died because 5’-3’ exonuclease activity was lost. 
Since the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity was essential and because mutant DNA pol I was not lethal, other DNA polymerases existed in  
E. coli. 
In 1970 & 1971 DNA Pol II and Pol III were isolated from  
E. coli.

Slide 22
Extra Table

------------------------------
Slide 23
DNA Polymerases 


DNA polymerases are the enzymes that catalyze the attachment of nucleotides to synthesize a new DNA strand 
In  
E. coli  
there are five proteins with polymerase activity 
DNA pol I, II, III, IV and V 
DNA pol I and III  
Normal replication 
DNA pol II, IV and V  
DNA

------------------------------
Slide 24
DNA Polymerases 


DNA pol III 
Responsible for most of the DNA replication 
Composed of 10 different subunits (Table 11.2) 
The  
α 
 subunit catalyzes bond formation between adjacent nucleotides (DNA synthesis) 
The other 9 fulfill other functions 
The complex of all 10 subunits is referred to as the  
DNA pol III  
holoenzyme 
DNA pol I 
Composed of a single polypeptide 
Removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA

11.2 Bacterial DNA Replication 


Bacterial DNA Replication: The formation of two replication forks at the origin of replication 
DNA synthesis begins at a site termed the origin of replication 
Each bacterial chromosome has only one origin of replication 
Synthesis of DNA proceeds  
bidirectionally 
 around the bacterial chromosome 
The two replication forks eventually meet at the opposite side of the bacterial chromosome 
This ends replication

Slide 31
GATC Methylation Sites in Replication 


GATC 
 methylation sites are involved in regulating replication 
Need to ensure only one round of replication!!! 
DNA adenine  
methyltransferase 
 (Dam)  
methylates 
 the A on both strands 
Immediately after replication, the daughter strand is not methylated 
Takes several minutes to become methylated 
Initiation of replication only occurs efficiently on fully methylated DNA 
Second round initiation is blocked 
[img31]

GATC 

------------------------------
Slide 32
11.3 Bacterial DNA Replication: Synthesis of New DNA strands 


Unwinding of the Helix: 
DNA helicase separates the two DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between them 
This generates positive supercoiling ahead of each replication fork 
Topoisomerase 
 II also called  
DNA  
gyrase 
  
travels ahead of the helicase and alleviates these supercoils 
Single-strand binding proteins  
bind to the separated DNA strands to keep them apart 
Bases are exposed and can hydrogen bond with individual nucleotides 
[img32]
------------------------------
Slide 33
Synthesis of RNA Primers and DNA 


Then short (10 to 12 nucleotides 
) RNA primers 
 are synthesized by  
primase 
These short RNA strands start, or prime, DNA synthesis 
Typically 10-12 nucleotides in length 
The leading strand has a single primer 
The lagging strand needs multiple primers 
They are eventually removed and replaced with DNA 
DNA polymerase  
enzymes are responsible for synthesizing the DNA 
[img33]
------------------------------
[img34]Slide 34
Proteins in Bacterial DNA Replication (Figure 11.7) 


Functions of key proteins involved with bacterial DNA replication 
DNA Helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between the DNA strands. 
Topoisomerase II alleviates positive supercoiling. 
Single-stranded binding proteins keep the parental strands apart 
Primase

------------------------------
Slide 35

Structure resembles a human right hand 
Template DNA is threaded through the palm;  
Thumb and fingers wrapped around the DNA 
Bacterial DNA polymerases may vary in their subunit composition 
However, they all have a similar catalytic subunit 

------------------------------
Slide 37
Features of DNA Polymerase (Figure 11.9) 


DNA polymerases cannot initiate DNA synthesis by linking two individual nucleotides 
Problem is overcome by the RNA primers synthesized by  
primase 
DNA polymerases can attach nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction, but the two strands are anti-parallel and go in opposite directions 
Problem is overcome by synthesizing the new strands both toward, and away from, the replication fork 
[img37]
------------------------------
Slide 38

[img38]
------------------------------
Slide 39
Synthesis of Leading and Lagging Strands 


The two new daughter strands are synthesized in different ways and opposite orientations 
Leading strand 
One RNA primer is made at the origin 
DNA pol III attaches nucleotides in a 5’ to 3’ direction as it slides toward the opening of the replication fork  
[img39]
------------------------------
Slide 40
Synthesis of Leading and Lagging Strands 


Lagging strand 
Synthesis is also in the 5’ to 3’ direction 
However it occurs away from the replication fork 
Many RNA primers are required 
DNA pol III uses the RNA primers to synthesize small DNA fragments (1000 to 2000 nucleotides in bacteria, 100-200 in eukaryotes) 
These are termed  
Okazaki fragments  
after their discoverers 
[img40]
------------------------------
Slide 41
DNA Synthesis at the Replication Fork (Figure 11.10) 


DNA pol I  
removes the RNA primers and fills the resulting gap with DNA 
It uses a 5’ to 3’  
exonuclease 
 activity to digest the RNA and 5’ to 3’ polymerase activity to replace it with DNA 
After the gap is filled a covalent bond is still missing 
DNA ligase  
catalyzes the formation of a  
phosphodiester 
 bond 
Thereby connecting the DNA fragments

DNA Replication Complexes 


DNA helicase and  
primase 
 are physically bound to each other to form a complex called the  
primosome 
This complex better coordinates the actions of helicase and  
primase 
The  
primosome 
 is physically associated with two DNA polymerase  
holoenzymes 
 to form the  
replisome 
[img48]
------------------------------
Slide 49
DNA Replication Complexes 


Two DNA pol III proteins act in concert to replicate both the leading and lagging strands 
The two proteins form a  
dimeric 
 DNA polymerase  
that moves as a unit toward the replication fork 
DNA polymerases can only synthesize DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction 
So synthesis of the leading strand is continuous 
And that of the lagging strand is discontinuous 
[img49]

This (nearly 3D) model fits current data, which indicates that the key 
replication proteins are closely associated at the fork.  Keep this in mind 
when studying the previous slides.

Slide 53
Lagging Strand Synthesis 


The lagging strand is looped 
This allows the attached DNA polymerase to synthesize the Okazaki fragments in the normal 5’ to 3’ direction 
The polymerase synthesizing the lagging strand is also moving toward the replication fork 
Upon completion of an Okazaki fragment, the enzyme releases the lagging template strand 
The clamp loader complex then reloads the polymerase at the next RNA primer 
Another loop is then formed 
This processed is repeated over and over again 
[img53]
------------------------------
Slide 54
DNA Polymerase III is a Processive Enzyme (1 of 2) 


DNA polymerase III remains attached to the template as it is synthesizing the daughter strand 
This  
processiv 
e 
 feature is due to several different subunits in the DNA pol III  
holoenzyme 
β 
 subunit forms a dimer in the shape of a ring around template DNA 
It is termed the  
clamp protein 
Once bound, the  
β 
 subunits can freely slide along  
dsDNA 
Promotes association of  
holoenzyme 
 with DNA 
Complex of several subunits functions as a  
clamp loader 

------------------------------
Slide 55
Animation on DNA replication 

------------------------------
Slide 56
DNA Polymerase III is a  
Processive 
 Enzyme (2 of 2) 


The effect of  
processivity 
 is quite remarkable 
In the absence of the  
β 
 subunit 
DNA pol III falls off the DNA template after about 10 nucleotides have been polymerized 
Its rate is ~ 20 nucleotides per second 
In the presence of the  
β 
 subunit 
DNA pol III stays on the DNA template long enough to polymerize up to 500,000 nucleotides 
Its rate is ~ 750 nucleotides per second 

------------------------------
Slide 57
Fidelity Mechanisms (1 of 4) 


DNA replication exhibits a high degree of  
fidelity 
Mistakes during the process are extremely rare 
DNA pol III makes only one mistake per 10 
8 
 bases made  
There are several reasons why fidelity is high 
Stability of base pairing 
Structure of the DNA polymerase active site 
Proofreading function of DNA polymerase  

------------------------------
Slide 58
Fidelity Mechanisms 


Stability of proper base pairs 
Complementary base pairs have much higher stability than mismatched pairs 
Stability of base pairs only accounts for part of the fidelity 
Error rate for mismatched base pairs is 1 per 1,000 nucleotides 
Configuration of the DNA polymerase active site 
Helix distortion caused by  
mispairing 
 prevents incorrect nucleotide fitting properly in active site 
This induced-fit phenomenon decreases the error rate to a range of 1 in 100,000 to 1 million  
[img58]
------------------------------
Slide 59
Fidelity Mechanisms 


Proofreading function of DNA polymerase 
DNA polymerases can identify a mismatched nucleotide and remove it from the daughter strand 
The enzyme uses a 3’ to 5’  
exonuclease 
 activity to digest the newly made strand until the mismatched nucleotide is removed 
DNA synthesis then resumes in the 5’ to 3’ direction  
[img59]
------------------------------
Slide 60
11.5 Eukaryotic DNA Replication 


Eukaryotic DNA replication is not as well understood as bacterial replication 
The two processes do have extensive similarities, 
The types of bacterial enzymes described in Table 11.1 have also been found in eukaryotes 
Nevertheless, DNA replication in eukaryotes is more complex 
Large linear chromosomes 
Chromatin is tightly packed within nucleosomes 
More complicated cell cycle regulation

key elements: 
Cyclin 
 => concentration 
increases and decreases 
in a cyclic manner.

When bound to  
cyclin, it is activated  
and will phosphorylate 
other proteins.

Slide 62
Initiation of DNA Replication 


If only one site of replication in human, then for 3.4 x 10 
9 
 (23 chromosomes) at a replication rate of 2kb/minute in human cells it would take 
				 830 hours/chromosome 
   Gestation of human fetus would be many years instead of 9 months. 
In Eukaryotes, it is obviously much faster. 
In Drosophila, a diploid set is replicated in 3 minutes 
Six times faster than  
E. coli 
, although there is 100 times more DNA in Drosophila. 
			 

------------------------------
Slide 63
Multiple Origins of Replication 


Eukaryotes have long linear chromosomes 
They therefore require multiple origins of replication  
To ensure that the DNA can be replicated in a reasonable amount of time 
In 1968,  
Huberman 
 and Riggs provided evidence for multiple origins of replication 
Refer to Figure 11.18	 
DNA replication proceeds  
bidirectionally 
 from many origins of replication 
 Refer to Figure 11.19

Slide 64
Evidence for Multiple Origins of Replication (Figure 11.18)

Eukaryotic Origins of Replication 


The origins of replication found in eukaryotes have some similarities to those of bacteria 
Origins of replication in Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are termed ARS elements ( 
A 
utonomously  
R 
eplicating  
S 
equence) 
They are about 50  
bp 
 in length 
They have a high percentage of A and T 
ARS consensus sequence (ACS) 
ATTTAT(A or G)TTTA 
Origins in more complex eukaryotes are not fully defined 
Many occur at sites defined by chromatin structure, not sequence

Slide 69
Eukaryotic Replication 
  
(Figure 11.20) 


Replication begins with assembly of the  
prereplication 
 complex (

)

Origin recognition complex (ORC) 
A six-subunit complex that acts as the first initiator of eukaryotic DNA replication  
Other  
preRC 
 proteins include  
MCM Helicase 
Binding of MCM completes  
DNA replication licensing 
These origins are able to begin DNA synthesis

Functions of DNA Polymerases in Replication 


DNA pol a  
is the only polymerase to associate with  
primase 
The DNA pol  
α 
/ 
primase 
 complex synthesizes a short RNA-DNA hybrid primer 
10 RNA nucleotides followed by 20 to 30 DNA nucleotides 
The exchange of DNA pol  
α 
 for  
ε 
 or  
δ 
 is required for elongation of the leading and lagging strands. 
This is called a  
polymerase switch  
DNA pol  
ε 
 is used for the  
processive 
 elongation of the leading strand 
DNA pol  
δ 
  
is used for the lagging strands 

------------------------------
Slide 72
Functions of DNA Polymerases in DNA Repair 


DNA polymerases also play a role in DNA repair 
DNA pol  
β 
 is not involved in DNA replication  
It plays a role in removal of incorrect bases from damaged DNA  
Recently, more DNA polymerases have been identified 
Many are  
translesion 
-replicating polymerases 
Involved in the replication of damaged DNA 
They can synthesize a complementary strand over the abnormal region 

------------------------------
Slide 73
Flap Endonuclease  
Removes RNA Primers 


Distinct from prokaryotic replication 
Polymerase  
δ 
 runs into primer of adjacent Okazaki fragment 
Pushes portion of primer into short flap 
Flap endonuclease  
removes the primer 
Long flaps are removed by DNA2 nuclease/helicase 
Cuts long flap into short flap

Slide 74
Telomeres and DNA Replication 


Linear eukaryotic chromosomes have telomeres at both ends 
The term  
telomere 
 refers to the complex of  
telomeric 
 DNA sequences and bound proteins 

------------------------------
Slide 75
Telomeric 
 DNA Sequences 


Telomeric 
 sequences consist of moderately repetitive tandem arrays 
3’ overhang that is 12-16 nucleotides long 
Telomeric 
 sequences typically consist of 
Several guanine nucleotides 
Many thymine nucleotides 
Refer to Table 11.5

When replicating 
the end of 
Chromosome the 
RNA primer  
leaves gap. 


Ends of chromosome  
called telomere.

Slide 77
Replication Problem at the Ends of Linear Chromosomes (1 of 2) 


DNA polymerases possess two unusual features 
They synthesize DNA only in the 5’ to 3’ direction 
They cannot initiate DNA synthesis 
At the 3’ ends of linear chromosomes - the end of the strand cannot be replicated! 
[img77]
------------------------------
Slide 78
Replication Problem at the Ends of Linear Chromosomes 


If this problem is not solved 
The linear chromosome becomes progressively shorter with each round of DNA replication 
Indeed, the cell solves this problem by adding DNA sequences to the ends of telomeres 
This requires a specialized mechanism catalyzed by the enzyme telomerase 
Telomerase contains protein and RNA 
The RNA is complementary to the DNA sequence found in the  
telomeric 
 repeat 
This allows the telomerase to bind to the 3’ overhang 
[img78]

Slide 79
Enzymatic Action of Telomerase (Figure 11.24) (1 of 2) 


Step 1: binding 
Step 2: polymerization 
Step 3: translocation 
These steps are repeated many times to lengthen one strand

[img80]

Gap correction at telomeres 


Synthesis of DNA from an RNA primer is 
called reverse transcription.  Therefore, 
Telomerase 
 is a Reverse Transcriptase.  

------------------------------
Slide 81
Telomere Length and Cancer 


Telomeres tend to shorten in actively dividing cells 
Telomere DNA is about 8,000  
bp 
 at birth 
Can shorten to 1,500 in elderly person 
Cells become senescent when telomeres are short 
Lose their ability to divide 
Insertion of highly active telomerase can block senescence 

------------------------------
Slide 82
Telomere Length and Cancer 


Cancer cells commonly carry mutations increasing activity of telomerase 
Prevents telomere shortening and senescence 
May be a target for anti-cancer drug treatments 

------------------------------
Slide 83
Telomerase Activity 


In mammalian cells, telomerase activity is limited to immortal cells (tumor cells and embryonic stem cells). 
When absent, as in normal cells, the result is a progressive shortening of chromosome. 
As a result, in normal cells, there is a limited number of cell divisions before a cell dies because the chromosomes are too short. 
[img83]

In vertebrates, the sequence of  
nucleotides in telomeres is TTAGGG.  
This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated  
approximately 2,500 times in humans. 
[1] 


This loop is analogous to a  
knot 
, which stabilizes the telomere,  
preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break  
points by the DNA repair machinery.

Slide 84
Histone Synthesis and Nucleosome Assembly: 
When DNA is doubled, the number of histones is also doubled. 


Histone synthesis (5 histone genes): 
Initiates transcription near the end of the G 
1 
 phase, which is just prior to the S phase. 
As DNA replication completes, histone transcription ends and histone mRNA is degraded. 
Nucleosome assembly: 
New DNA is assembled into nucleosome almost immediately. 
However, there is a nucleosome –free zone, which consist of 200-300 bp around the replication fork. 

------------------------------
[img85]Slide 85
Figure 3.16 Assembly of new nucleosomes at a replication fork. New nucleosomes are  
assembled first with the use of either a parental or a new H3–H4 tetramer and then by  
completing the structure with a pair of H2A–H2B dimers.
