Introduction 


The translation of the mRNA codons into amino acid sequences leads to the synthesis of proteins 
A variety of cellular components play important roles in translation 
These include proteins, RNAs and small molecules 
In this chapter we will discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the molecular features of mRNA translation 

------------------------------
Slide 5
13.1 The Genetic Basis For Protein Synthesis 


Proteins are the active participants in cell structure and function 
Genes that encode polypeptides are termed protein-encoding genes or structural genes 
These are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) 
The main function of the genetic material is to encode the production of cellular proteins 
In the correct cell, at the proper time, and in suitable amounts 

------------------------------
Slide 6
Archibald Garrod (1 of 2) 


First to propose (at the beginning of the 20 
th 
 century) a relationship between genes and protein production 
Garrod studied patients who had defects in their ability to metabolize certain compounds 
He was particularly interested in  
alkaptonuria 
Patients bodies accumulate abnormal levels of homogentisic acid (alkapton) 
Disease characterized by 
Black urine and bluish black discoloration of cartilage and skin 
[img6][img6]
------------------------------
Slide 7
Archibald Garrod (2 of 2) 


He proposed that alkaptonuria was due to a missing enzyme, namely homogentisic  
acid oxidase 
Garrod also knew that alkaptonuria follows a recessive pattern of inheritance 
He proposed that a  
relationship exists  
between the inheritance of the trait and the inheritance of a defective enzyme 
He described the disease as an  
inborn error of metabolism 

------------------------------
Slide 8
Garrod’s 
 Hypothesis of Inborn Errors of Metabolism 


Garrod’s 
 work provided the first evidence of a specific relationship between genes and enzymes. That is, suggested that mysterious diseases could be explained as inborn errors of metabolism. 
In normal people HA is not excreted but is metabolized. 
Garrod’s 
 group reasoned that the position of a block in a metabolic pathway can be determined by the accumulation of the chemical compound proceeding the block.  
In the case of  
Alkaptonurics 
, the accumulated chemical compound is  
homogentistic 
 acid.

Slide 10
Beadle and Tatum’s Experiments (1 of 2) 


In the early 1940s, George Beadle and Edward Tatum were also interested in the relationship between genes, enzymes and traits 
They specifically asked this question 
Is it  
One gene–one enzyme 
 or  
one gene–many enzymes? 
Their genetic model was  
Neurospora 
  
crassa 
  
(a common bread mold) 
Their studies involved the analysis of simple nutritional requirements 

------------------------------
Slide 11
One Gene-One Enzyme Hypothesis 
G. Beadle and E. Tatum (1942) 


Their work herald the “Beginnings of Biochemical Genetics” 
They studied the haploid Red Bread Mold  
	fungus called  
Neurospora  
crassa 
. 
Showed a direct relationship between genes and enzymes, which is a landmark in genetics and won them the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.

------------------------------
Slide 13
Beadle and Tatum’s  
Experimental Design 


Neurospora 
 has simple growth requirements: 
Wild-type  
Neurospora 
 can grow on simple media containing only inorganic salts (provides nitrogen source), an organic carbon source (glucose or sucrose), and the vitamin biotin (enzyme co-factor). 
Neurospora 
 synthesized the other material needed for growth, e.g., amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, nucleic acids, and proteins.   

------------------------------
Slide 14
Beadle and Tatum’s  
Experimental Design 


Because of this nutrient requirement (i.e., make all material needed for growth from minimal material), it was evident that they could isolate nutritional mutants ( 
auxotrophic mutants or  
auxotrophs 
) that required nutritional supplements to grow. 
The wild type strain that grow on simple  
minimal media 
 are called  
prototrophic mutants or  
prototrophs 
.

Slide 16
Beadle and Tatum’s Experiments (2 of 2)

(b) Simplified pathway for methionine biosynthesis 

------------------------------
Slide 20
Beadle and Tatum’s Experiments 


In the normal strains, methionine was synthesized by cellular enzymes 
In the mutant strains, a genetic defect in one gene prevented the synthesis of one protein required in one step of the pathway to produce that amino acid 
Beadle and Tatum’s conclusion: 
 A single gene controlled the synthesis of a single enzyme 
This was referred to as the  
one gene–one enzyme 
 hypothesis 

------------------------------
Slide 21
Beadle and Tatum 
Nobel prize in medicine, 1958 
One Gene-One Enzyme Hypothesis 


Beadle and Tatum were able to determine the sequence of steps in the pathway and related each step to a specific gene or set of genes. 
Their hypothesis is basically true. 
However, we now know that 
More than one gene may control each step in a pathway. 
An enzyme may have two or more different polypeptide chains, each coded by a different gene. 
Therefore, the original hypothesis is now 
		   
One Gene-One Polypeptide 
	 
DSCAM now possibly 38,016  
	protein isoforms off one gene. 
Splicing was discovered in 1977 by Phillip Sharp and Richard J. Roberts, Nobel in 1997

For Example 
Sickle-cell Anemia 
 


The sickled red blood cell looses it characteristic disc shape in low oxygen tension  
and forms the sickle cell.  The sickle cell, which is more fragile and less flexible,  
will clog capillaries, impair circulation and deprive cells of oxygen.

Fig. 4.9  The hemoglobin molecule 
[img24]

Sickle-cell anemia is caused 
by changes in hemoglobin, 
which is the oxygen transporting 
protein in red blood cells. 
Homozygous mutants have  
mutation in both  
-globin  
genes, which produces  
the -polypeptide. 
Wild-type (  
A 
) is codominant  
with sickle-cell mutation (  
S 
). 
therefore, a heterozygote ( 
A  
 
S 
) 
will have both red blood cells 

------------------------------
Slide 25
Modification of One Gene-One Enzyme Theory (1 of 2) 


Enzymes are only one category of proteins 
Some proteins are composed of two or more different polypeptides 
The term polypeptide denotes structure 
The term protein denotes function 
So it is more accurate to say a structural gene encodes a polypeptide. 

------------------------------
Slide 26
Modification of One Gene-One Enzyme Theory (2 of 2) 


Many genes have been identified that do not encode polypeptides 
For instance, functional RNA molecules (tRNA, rRNA, etc.) 
One gene can encode multiple polypeptides through alternative splicing

What is the difference between a polypeptide and a protein? 
 


David  
Talaga 
, Professor of Physical Chemistry 
Written Mar 10, 2015 
Polypeptide refers to a polymer linked by peptide bonds. Peptide bonds are formed by a condensation reaction between amino acids. So a polypeptide has amino acids as the monomer unit. 
 
All proteins are polypeptides. 
 
Protein scientists typically distinguish between polypeptides and proteins based on structure. Proteins are polypeptides that fold into a fixed structure. Most polypeptides shorter than about 40 amino acids in length do not fold. So, you will often see people use polymer length to distinguish proteins from polypeptides.  
 
To summarize: 
All proteins are polypeptides. 
Proteins tend to have a well defined 3D structure. 
The term polypeptides is often reserved for the shorter, unstructured polypeptides that do not fold into a protein structure. 

------------------------------
Slide 35
Genetic Code is a Triplet Code 


Crick et. al., performed genetic experiments using the bacteriophage T4 ( 
rII 
 mutants). 
In these experiments, they used a mutagen ( 
proflavin 
) which causes a frameshift or reversion type mutation. 
Determined that a set of 3 nucleotides (a codon) in mRNA codes for one amino acid in a polypeptide chain.

Slide 38
Deciphering the Genetic Code 


Using a Cell-free, protein-synthesizing system from  
E. coli 
 and synthetic mRNAs, researchers determined that the genetic code had the following properties: 
Triplet Code 
The code is comma-free; i.e., it is continuous. 
It is non-overlapping 
It is almost universal (mitochondria) 
The code is degenerate. 
Has start and stop signals.

	Carrying  
an amino acid that is specific for that  
	codon

A Polypeptide Chain has Directionality 


Polypeptide synthesis has a directionality that parallels the 5’ to 3’ orientation of mRNA 
During each cycle of elongation, a peptide bond is formed between  
the carboxyl  
group of the last amino acid in the polypeptide chain and the amino group in the amino acid being added 
The first amino acid has  
an exposed  
amino group 
Said to be N-terminal or amino terminal end 
The last amino acid has  
an exposed carboxyl  
group 
Said to be C-terminal

Three Steps to Translation: 
Initiation > Elongation > Termination 


Initiation Codon:  AUG 
In Prokaryotes, start AUG codes for formyl-Methionine (

), while an AUG within the coding sequence codes for a methionine. 
In Eukaryotes, start AUG codes for a special  
tRNA 
-Met, while another  
tRNA 
-Met is used for internal AUGs in the coding sequence

Slide 65
Initiation of Translation in Eukaryotes 


Initiation is similar in Eukaryotes, called  
Scanning model for initiation 
, the main differences are: 
The initiator methionine is unmodified, but uses a special  
tRNA 
. 
No Shine- 
Dalgarno 
 sequence is used. 
Eukaryotes use another way to find the initiating codon: 
First an initiation factor, eIF-4F, which is a  
multimer 
 of several proteins that include the cap-binding protein, binds the cap at the 5’ end of the mRNA. 
Then a complex of 40S ribosomal subunit, initiating Met- 
tRNA 
, several  
eIF 
 proteins and GTP bind and then scan the mRNA for Initiation AUG Codon that is buried in a short sequence called the  
Kozak 
 sequence  
( 
gccRccAUGG 
) 
.    
Typically, the first AUG of the mRNA is the Start.

Secreted proteins, membrane bound proteins and lysosomal proteins 

------------------------------
Slide 76
Mitochondria and Chloroplast 


Ribosomal proteins, enzymes of electron transport system and enzyme for photosynthesis are all translocated from the cytoplasm (not in association with membrane) and are  
posttranslationally 
 transported into these organelles. 
N-terminus has a “transit sequence” for import into specific organelle and the sequence is then removed. 

------------------------------
Slide 77
Nucleus 


Ribosomal proteins (for assembly), histones and  
nonhistone 
 chromosomal proteins, Gene regulatory proteins and Enzymes for replication, repair, recombination, transcription and RNA processing. 
Nuclear proteins have a nuclear localization sequence, which has them  
posttranslationally 
 transported without the removal of the localization sequence.
