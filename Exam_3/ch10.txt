The Organization of DNA in Chromosomes 


	 
In order to understand how gene expression is controlled, it is important to understand how DNA is organized in chromosomes. 
  
[img3]
------------------------------
Slide 4
Introduction 


Chromosomes are the structures that contain the genetic material 
They are complexes of DNA and proteins 
The genome comprises all the genetic material that an organism possesses 
In bacteria, it is typically a single circular chromosome 
In eukaryotes, it refers to one complete set of nuclear chromosomes 
Note: 
Eukaryotes possess a mitochondrial genome 
Plants also have a chloroplast genome 

------------------------------
Slide 5
Introduction 


The main function of the genetic material is to store the information required to produce an organism 
The DNA molecule does that through its base sequence 
DNA sequences are necessary for  
Synthesis of RNA and cellular proteins 
Replication of chromosomes 
Proper segregation of chromosomes 
Compaction of chromosomes 
So they can fit within living cells 

------------------------------
[img6]Slide 6
10.1 Organization of Bacterial Chromosomes 


Bacterial chromosomal DNA is usually a circular molecule that is a few million nucleotides in length 
Escherichia coli  
 ~ 4.6 million base pairs 
Haemophilus influenzae  
 ~ 1.8 million base pairs 
A typical bacterial chromosome contains a few thousand different genes 
Protein-encoding genes (Structural genes) account for the majority of bacterial DNA 
The nontranscribed DNA between adjacent genes are termed intergenic regions 

------------------------------
Slide 7
Organization of Bacterial Chromosome (2 of 3) 


Key features: 
Most, but not all, bacterial species contain circular chromosomal DNA. 
Most bacterial species contain a single type of chromosome, but it may be present in multiple copies. 
A typical chromosome is a few million base pairs in length. 
[img7]
------------------------------
Slide 8
Organization of Bacterial Chromosome (3 of 3) 


Several thousand different genes are interspersed throughout the chromosome. The short regions between adjacent genes are called intergenic regions. 
One origin of replication is required to initiate DNA replication. 
Repetitive sequences may be interspersed throughout the chromosome. 
[img8]
------------------------------
Slide 9
10.2 Structure of Bacterial Chromosomes 


The bacterial chromosome is found in a region of the cell called the nucleoid 
The nucleoid is not bounded by membrane 
So the DNA is in direct contact with the cytoplasm

------------------------------
Slide 10
Loop Domains within a Bacterial Chromosome (1 of 2) 


To fit within the bacterial cell, the chromosomal DNA must be compacted about a 1000-fold 
This involves the formation of loop domains ( 
microdomains 
) 
Number of loops varies according to the size of the bacterial chromosome and the species 
E. coli 
 has 50-100 with 40,000 to 80,000 bp of DNA in each loop 
[img10]

Slide 12
The Organization of DNA in Chromosomes 


In bacteria, DNA is present as a single chromosome of 4 x 10 
3 
 kb (1,100  
m long) 
Has all the genes for the bacterium to grow and survive its environment. 
The amount of DNA is 500 times the length of the  
E 
.  
coli 
 cell. 
How is all the DNA packaged into the nucleoid region of the  
E 
.  
coli 
 cell? 

------------------------------
Slide 13
DNA Supercoiling Further Compacts Bacterial Chromosome (1 of 2) 


Because the two strands within DNA already coil around each other, the formation of additional coils due to twisting forces is referred to as  
DNA supercoiling. 
Both underwinding and overwinding of the DNA double helix can cause supercoiling

Fig. 2.20  Illustration of DNA supercoiling 
[img14]

DNA in the bacterium exist in a 
relaxed and supercoiled form. 
See figure 2.23 


Relaxed 


Supercoiled: 
tension is 
created in 
the DNA 





------------------------------
Slide 15

Magnification is the same. 

------------------------------
Slide 16
The Organization of DNA in Chromosomes 


Same size DNA is in relaxed and supercoiled form.  Magnification is the same. 
Supercoiling can even occur in linear DNA.                  Occurs in localized regions of linear DNA. 
Two types of supercoiling:  Either type causes compaction. 
Negative supercoil:   
DNA is basically untwisted;  untwisted in the opposite direction from the clockwise turns of the right-handed double helix. 
Positive supercoil:   
DNA is twisted tighter;  twisted in the same direction as the clockwise turns on the helix. 
[img16]
------------------------------
[img17]Slide 17
DNA Supercoiling Further Compacts Bacterial Chromosome (2 of 2) 


DNA given a turn that unwinds the helix 
can cause fewer turns OR can cause a negative supercoil to form 
DNA given a turn that overwinds the helix 
either more turns OR the formation of a positive supercoil 
These forms are  
topoisomers 

------------------------------
Slide 18
Chromosome Function is Influenced by DNA Supercoiling 


The chromosomal DNA in bacteria is negatively supercoiled 
In  
E. coli 
, there is one negative supercoil per 40 turns of the double helix. 
Negative supercoiling has two major effects 
1. Helps in the compaction of the chromosome 
2. Creates tension that may be released by DNA strand separation 
[img18]
------------------------------
Slide 19
Control of Supercoiling 


The control of supercoiling in bacteria is accomplished by two main enzymes 
DNA gyrase  
(also termed DNA topoisomerase II) 
Introduces negative supercoils using energy from ATP 
It can also relax positive supercoils when they occur 
Can untangle intertwined DNA molecules 
DNA topoisomerase I  
Relaxes negative supercoils 
The competing action of these two enzymes governs the overall supercoiling of bacterial DNA 

------------------------------
Slide 20
The Action of DNA Gyrase 
[img20]
------------------------------
Slide 21
DNA Gyrase (1 of 2) 


The ability of gyrase to introduce negative supercoils into DNA is crucial for bacteria to survive 
Blocking the function of this enzyme is a way to cure or alleviate bacterial diseases 
Two main classes of drugs inhibit gyrase and other bacterial topoisomerases 

------------------------------
Slide 22

Slide 24
10.3 Organization of Eukaryotic Chromosomes 


Eukaryotic species contain one or more sets of chromosomes 
Each set is composed of several different linear chromosomes 
Humans have 2 sets of 23 chromosomes 
Each chromosome contains a single, linear molecule of DNA 
Typically tens to hundreds of millions of base pairs 
Typically a few hundred to several thousand genes 
Refer to Figure 10.8 

------------------------------
Slide 25
Eukaryotic Chromosomes 


In lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) 
Genes are relatively small 
They primarily contain the sequences that encode the amino acid sequences within proteins 
i.e.: Very few, short introns are present 
In higher eukaryotes (such as mammals) 
Genes are long 
They tend to have many introns (noncoding intervening sequences) 
Intron lengths from less than 100 to more than 10,000 bp 

------------------------------
Slide 26
Organization of Eukaryotic Chromosomes 


Three types of DNA sequences are required for chromosomal replication and segregation 
Origins of replication 
Multiple Chromosomal sites necessary to initiate DNA replication 
Centromeres 
Regions that play a role in segregation of chromosomes 
Telomeres 
Specialized regions at the ends of chromosomes 
Important in replication and for stability 
[img26]
------------------------------
Slide 27
Sizes of Eukaryotic Genomes and Repetitive Sequnces 


The total amount of DNA in eukaryotic species is typically much greater than that in bacterial cells 
Contain many more genes 
Eukaryotic genomes vary substantially in size 
[img27]
------------------------------
Slide 28
Sizes of Eukaryotic Genomes 


In many cases, this variation is not related to the complexity of the species  
For example, there is a two fold difference in the size of the genome in two closely related salamander species 
The difference in the size of the genome is not because of extra genes 
Rather, the accumulation of repetitive DNA sequences  
These do not encode proteins 
[img28]
------------------------------
[img29]Slide 29
Repetitive Sequences 


Sequence complexity refers to the number of times a particular base sequence appears in the genome 
There are three main types of repetitive sequences 
Unique or non-repetitive 
Moderately repetitive 
Highly repetitive 

------------------------------
Slide 30
Repetitive Sequences 


Unique or non-repetitive sequences 
Found once or a few times in the genome 
Includes structural genes as well as intergenic areas 
In humans, make up roughly 41% of the genome 
Moderately repetitive 
Found a few hundred to several thousand times 
Includes  
Genes for rRNA and histones 
Sequences that regulate gene expression and translation 
Transposable elements 
Discussed in detail in Chapter 19 
Highly repetitive 
Found tens of thousands to millions of times 
Each copy is relatively short (a few nucleotides to several hundred in length) 

------------------------------
Slide 31
Repetitive Sequences 


Some sequences are interspersed throughout the genome 
Example: Alu family in humans 
Approximately 300 bp long 
Represents 10% of human genome 
Found every 5000-6000 bp 
Discussed in detail in Chapter 19 
Other sequences are clustered together in tandem arrays 
Example: AATAT and AATATAT sequences in Drosophila 
These are commonly found in the centromeric regions 

------------------------------
Slide 32
Structure of Eukaryotic Chromosomes in Nondividing Cells 


If stretched end to end, a single set of human chromosomes would be over  
1 meter  
long! 
Yet the cell’s nucleus is only 2 to 4 µm (micrometer: 1,000,000 per meter) in diameter 
Therefore, the DNA must be tightly compacted to fit within the nucleus 
The compaction of linear DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes involves interactions between DNA and several different proteins 
The DNA-protein complex is called  
chromatin 
Proteins bound to DNA are subject to change during the life of the cell 
These changes affect the degree of chromatin compaction 

------------------------------
Slide 33
Molecular Structure of the Eukaryotic  
Chromosome 


Chromatin:  Two types. 
Euchromatin: 
 (stains lightly) It is uncoiled during interphase and coiled at mitosis.  Most of the genome is euchromatin, which is genetically active. 
Heterochromatin: 
 (stains dark) It is highly condensed and genetically inactive (either no genes or genes are turned off) 
[img33]

------------------------------
Slide 34
Nucleosomes 
Nucleosome Structure 


The repeating structural unit within eukaryotic chromatin is the  
nucleosome 
It is composed of a double-stranded segment of DNA wrapped around an octamer of  
histone proteins 
A histone octamer is composed of two copies each of four different histone proteins 
146 bp of DNA make 1.65 negative superhelical turns around the octamer 
[img34]
------------------------------
Slide 35
Histones (1 of 2) 


Histone proteins  
are basic 
They contain many positively-charged amino acids 
Lysine and arginine 
These bind to the phosphates along the DNA backbone 
Have a globular domain and a flexible, charged amino terminus or ‘tail’ 

------------------------------
Slide 36
Histones (2 of 2) 


There are five types of histones 
H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are the core histones 
Two of each make up the octamer 
H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone proteins have the most highly conserved sequence of all know proteins.  H4 of cow vs.  Garden pea is different by 2 aa.   
H1 is called the linker histone 
Binds to DNA in the linker region 
Less tightly bound to DNA than core histones 
May help compact adjacent nucleosomes 
H1 is not as highly conserved.

Slide 40
Nucleosomes Join to Form a 30 nm Fiber (1 of 2) 


Nucleosomes associate with each other to form a more compact structure termed the 30 nm fiber 
Histone H1 plays a role in this compaction 
At moderate salt concentrations, H1 is removed 
The result is the classic beads-on-a-string morphology 
At low salt concentrations, H1 remains bound 
Beads associate together into a more compact morphology

Slide 43
Nucleosomes Join to Form a 30 nm Fiber (2 of 2) 


The 30 nm fiber shortens the total length of DNA another seven-fold 
Its structure has proven difficult to determine 
The DNA conformation may be substantially altered when extracted from living cells 
Two models have been proposed 
Solenoid model 
Three-dimensional zigzag model

Further Compaction of the Chromosome (1 of 2) 


The two events we have discussed so far have shortened the DNA about 50-fold 
A third level of compaction involves interaction between the 30 nm fiber and the  
nuclear matrix 
The nuclear matrix is composed of two parts 
Nuclear lamina 
Fibers that line the inner nuclear membrane 
Internal matrix proteins 
Connected to nuclear lamina and fills interior of nucleus 
Structural and functional role remains controversial 
[img46]

Lamins

Slide 47
Further Compaction of the Chromosome (2 of 2) 


The attachment of radial loops to the nuclear matrix is important in two ways 
It plays a role in compaction 
It serves to organize the chromosomes within the nucleus 
Each chromosome in the nucleus is located in a discrete and nonoverlapping  
chromosome 
  
territory 

------------------------------
Slide 48
The Nuclear Matrix 


The nuclear matrix is hypothesized to be an intricate fine network of irregular protein fibers plus many other proteins bound to these fibers. 
This structure is very dynamic and complex. 
[img48]

------------------------------
Slide 49
Radial Loop Domains 


The third mechanism of DNA compaction involves the formation of  
radial loop domains 
25,000 – 200,000 bp 
Matrix-attachment regions (MARs), or scaffold-attachment regions (SARs),  
anchored to nuclear matrix

Slide 51
Heterochromatin versus Euchromatin 


The compaction level of interphase chromosomes is not completely uniform 
Heterochromatin 
Tightly compacted regions of chromosomes 
Transcriptionally inactive (in general) 
Radial loop domains compacted even further 
Euchromatin 
Less condensed regions of chromosomes 
Transcriptionally active 
The 30 nm fiber forms radial loop domains 

------------------------------
Slide 52
Types of Heterochromatin 


There are two types of heterochromatin 
Constitutive heterochromatin 
Regions that are always heterochromatic 
Permanently inactive with regard to transcription 
Usually contain highly repetitive sequences 
Facultative heterochromatin 
Regions that can interconvert between euchromatin and heterochromatin 
[img52]
------------------------------
Slide 53
10.6 Structure of Eukaryotic Chromosomes During Cell Division 


As cells enter M phase, the level of compaction changes dramatically 
By the end of prophase, sister chromatids are entirely heterochromatic 
Two parallel chromatids have an overall diameter of 1,400 nm and are much shorter than in interphase 
These highly condensed metaphase chromosomes undergo little gene transcription

Condensin and Cohesin Promote the Formation of Metaphase Chromosomes 


Two multiprotein complexes help to form and organize metaphase chromosomes 
Condensin
