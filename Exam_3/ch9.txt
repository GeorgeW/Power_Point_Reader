Now that I have your Attention! 
Lets learn about – 
The Genetic Material 


“The double helix is indeed a remarkable molecule. Modern man is perhaps 50,000 years old,  
civilization has existed for scarcely 10,000 years and the United States for only just over 200 years;  
but DNA and RNA have been around for at least several billion years.  
All that time the double helix has been there, and active, and yet we are the first creatures on  
Earth to become aware of its existence.”  
Francis Crick (1916–2004).

In this chapter we will shift our attention to molecular genetics 
The study of DNA structure and function at the molecular level 
Recent dramatic advances in techniques and approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of molecular genetics 
And also of transmission and population genetics 
To a large extent, our knowledge of genetics comes from our knowledge of the molecular structure of DNA and RNA

Slide 5
1869 was a landmark year in genetic research 
NUCLEIN 
was discovered by physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher  
[img5]

In a 1971 essay on the history of nucleic acid research, Erwin Chargaff noted that in a  
1961 historical account of nineteenth-century science, Charles Darwin was mentioned  
31 times, Thomas Huxley 14 times, but Miescher not even once.  
This omission is all the  
more remarkable given that, as Chargaff also noted, Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids  
was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components  
(i.e., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids)  
in that it could be "dated precisely... [to] one man, one place, one date." 


Furthermore, he suggested it played a role in fertilization 
: 
  
Miescher himself came auspiciously  
close to uncovering the correct answer. In his publication he wrote:  
“If one […] wants to assume that a single substance [...] is the specific cause of fertilization,  
then one should undoubtedly first and foremost consider  
nuclein 
.” (Miescher  
1874b 
).

Slide 6
DNA is a fine, spirally coiled thread in the nucleus of every  
living cell that serves as a guidebook so the cells "know"  
what they're supposed to do.  The strands are so fine you  
need a high power electron microscopes to see them. 
The human genome, the genetic code in each human cell contains  
23 sets of Chromosomes. In that human cell,depending on whether  
it is from a female or a male, there can be 23 
or 24 different DNA molecules, respectively. 
Each DNA molecule can contain from 500 thousand to  
2.5 million nucleotide pairs.  
DNA molecules of this size are 1.7 to 8.5 cm  
long when uncoiled, or about 5 cm on average.

Note:  This could be on the test! 


Your DNA would reach the moon  
Your DNA would actually stretch  
to the sun and back 
 about 4 times! 
[img6][img6][img6]
------------------------------
Slide 7
You have about 10 trillion cells in your body, so if you stretched the DNA in all the  
cells out, end to end, they'd  
stretch over 744 million miles. 
 The moon is only about  
250,000 miles away, so all your DNA would stretch to the moon and back almost  
1500 times. The sun is 93,000,000 miles away, so your DNA would reach there and  
back about 4 times! Or 30, or 300, or 600 times?  Variation is due to the estimated  
number of cells in the body. 
Interestingly, no more than 1.5 percent of the human genome contains DNA  
that helps "build" us, that "maps for proteins" as it's called. The other 98.5 percent  
Is either “junk” or control components that we are not sure how it is used,  
which has accumulated or been modified through the evolutionary process.  
For example, 90 percent of yeast genes have counterparts  
in humans, and there are 223 genes in humans that match those in bacteria but aren't  
found in intermediate organisms! Apparently, these genes jumped directly from  
bacteria to humans, or vice versa.

9.1 Identification of DNA as the Genetic Material 


To fulfill its role, the genetic material must meet several criteria 
Information: It must contain the information necessary to make an entire organism 
Transmission: It must be passed from parent to offspring 
Replication: It must be copied  
In order to be passed from parent to offspring 
Variation: It must be capable of changes 
To account for the known phenotypic variation in each species 

------------------------------
Slide 10
9.1 Identification of DNA as the Genetic Material (2 of 2) 


The data of many geneticists, including Mendel, were consistent with these four properties 
However, the chemical nature of the genetic material cannot be identified solely by genetic crosses 
Indeed, the identification of DNA as the genetic material involved a series of outstanding experimental approaches 
These will be examined next 

------------------------------
Slide 11
Discovery of DNA as the Genetic Material 


S strain:  infectious (virulent) and has a polysaccharide coat.  Infection will result in the death of the animal.  Two substrains: IIS and IIIS. 
R strain:  Noninfectious (avirulent) and has no polysaccharide coat.   
One out of 10 
7 
 S cells will mutate into R, i.e., type IIS into IIR.  However, the reverse is very rare, i.e., only IIR into IIS never into IIIS.  


Griffith’s Transformation Experiment:  Used two strains of  
Streptococcus 
  
pneumoniae 
 (pneumococcus). 




Polysaccharide coat inhibits the killing action of the host’s immune system.

Fig. 2.2  Griffith’s transformation experiment 1928 


Type IIR is derived from IIS (very rare conversion). 


Agent involved in this transformation was called the “Transforming Principle.” 
Griffith believed that the Transforming principle was the protein. 



------------------------------
Slide 13
We now know that the Transforming Principle is DNA 


In Griffith’s experiment, the heat-killed type IIIS bacteria release their DNA, which was absorbed by the type IIR and by DNA recombination the type IIR bacteria were transformed into type IIIS virulent bacteria. 
[img13][img13][img13][img13][img13][img13][img13][img13]
------------------------------
Slide 14
How was it determined that the transforming principle was DNA instead of Protein? 
[img14][img14]

A chemical method (A modern DNA miniprep) was used to isolate chemically pure transforming principle from  
lyzed 
 type IIIS bacteria cells. 
This procedure separates the lysate into various cellular macromolecular components:  lipids, polysaccharides, proteins, DNA and RNA. 

------------------------------
Slide 15
The Experiments of Avery, MacLeod and McCarty (1 of 3) 


Avery, MacLeod and McCarty realized that Griffith’s observations could be used to identify the genetic material 
They carried out their experiments in the 1940s 
At that time, it was known that DNA, RNA, proteins and carbohydrates are the major constituents of living cells

Fig. 2.3   Experiment that showed that DNA, not RNA, was the transforming principle 


In 1944, Avery and colleagues isolated DNA and RNA and tested with crude extracts of nucleases. 


Demonstrates that the  
transforming principle  
is DNA. 


However, data was criticized because the DNA was not pure.  It was contaminated with protein.

Slide 20
Overview of DNA and RNA Structure 


DNA and RNA are large macromolecules with several levels of complexity 
Nucleotides form the repeating unit of nucleic acids 
Nucleotides are linked to form a linear strand of RNA or DNA 
Two strands can interact to form a double helix 
The 3-D structure of DNA results from folding and bending of the double helix. Interaction of DNA with proteins produces chromosomes within living cells 
[img20][img20][img20][img20]
------------------------------
Slide 21
9.3 Nucleotide Structure (1 of 2) 


The  
nucleotide 
 is the repeating structural unit of DNA and RNA 
It has three components 
A phosphate group 
A pentose sugar 
Ribose in RNA 
Deoxyribose in DNA 
A nitrogenous base 
Refer to Figure 9.5

Terminology of Nucleic Acid Units 


Base + sugar is a 
  
nucleoside 
Example 
Adenine + ribose = Adenosine 
Adenine + deoxyribose =  
Deoxyadenosine 
Base + sugar + phosphate(s) is a 
  
nucleotide 
Example 
Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) 
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
[img24]

[img25]Slide 25
9.4 Structure of a DNA Strand 


Nucleotides are covalently linked together by  
phosphodiester 
 bonds 
A phosphate connects the 5’ carbon of one nucleotide to the 3’ carbon of another  
Therefore the strand has  
directionality 
5’ to 3’ 
In a strand, all sugar molecules are oriented in the same direction 
The phosphates and sugar molecules form the  
backbone 
 of the nucleic acid strand 
The bases project from the backbone 

------------------------------
Slide 26
9.5 Discovery of the Double Helix 


In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick elucidated the double helical structure of DNA 
The scientific framework for their breakthrough was provided by other scientists including 
Linus Pauling 
Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins 
Erwin Chargaff 

------------------------------
Slide 27
Linus Pauling and the  
α 
 helix 


In the early 1950s, he proposed that regions of protein can fold into a secondary structure 
α-helix 
To elucidate this structure, he built ball-and-stick models

Slide 28
Rosalind Franklin Performed  
X-ray Diffraction of DNA Fibers (1 of 4) 


She worked in the same laboratory as Maurice Wilkins 
She used X-ray diffraction to study wet fibers of DNA 
The diffraction pattern is interpreted (using mathematical theory) 
This can ultimately provide information concerning the structure of the molecule 
[img28]
------------------------------
Slide 29
Rosalind Franklin Performed  
X-ray Diffraction of DNA Fibers (3 of 4) 


She made marked advances in X-ray diffraction techniques with DNA 
The diffraction pattern she obtained suggested several structural features of DNA 
Helical 
More than one strand 
10 base pairs per complete turn 
These findings were instrumental in solving the structure of DNA

Slide 30
Erwin Chargaff’s Experiment 


Chargaff pioneered many of the biochemical techniques for the isolation, purification and measurement of nucleic acids from living cells 
It was known that DNA contained the four bases: A, G, C and T 
Chargaff analyzed the base composition of DNA isolated from many different species 
The Goal (Discovery-based science) 
An analysis of the base composition of DNA in different species may reveal important features about the structure of DNA 
Chargaff's rules state  
that DNA from any cell of any organisms should have a 1:1 ratio (base Pair Rule) of pyrimidine and purine bases and, more specifically, that the amount of guanine should be equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to  
thymin 
[img30]
------------------------------
Slide 31
The Physical Structure of DNA:  
The Double helix 


In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published the Double Helix model for the DNA structure.  This model was based on the following DATA: 
DNA was composed of bases, sugars, and phosphates which were linked as a polynucleotide. 
The amount of A = T and G = C. 
The ratio of (A + T)/(G + C) varies with organisms.

Slide 43
DNA can Form a Triple Helix 


In 1957 Alexander Rich et al. discovered triplex DNA 
It was formed in vitro using DNA pieces that were made synthetically 
In the 1980s, it was discovered that natural double- stranded DNA can join with a synthetic strand of DNA to form triplex DNA 
The synthetic strand binds to the major groove of the naturally-occurring double-stranded DNA 
Triplex DNA formation is sequence specific 
T binds to an AT pair in biological DNA 
C binds to a CG pair in biological DNA 
Triplex DNA has been implicated in several cellular processes 
Recombination, inactivation of specific genes 
Potential tool for therapeutic gene inactivation

RNA Structure 


The primary structure of an RNA strand is much like that of a DNA strand 
Compare Figures 9.16 & 9.7 
RNA uses Uracil as a base 
RNA uses Ribose with 2’ OH 
RNA strands are typically several hundred to several thousand nucleotides in length 
In RNA synthesis, only one of the two strands of DNA is used as a template 
[img44]

Slide 45
Structure of RNA Molecules 


Although usually single-stranded, RNA molecules can form short double-stranded regions 
This secondary structure is due to complementary base-pairing 
A to U and C to G 
Allows short regions to form a double helix 
RNA double helices typically 
Are right-handed 
Have the A form with 11 to 12 base pairs per turn 
Different types of RNA secondary structures are possible
