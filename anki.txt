Slide 4
Introduction 


The term mutation refers to a heritable change in the genetic material 
Mutations provide allelic variations 
On the positive side 
, mutations are the foundation for evolutionary change needed for a species to adapt to changes in the environment 
On the negative side 
, new mutations are much more likely to be harmful than beneficial to the individual and often are the cause of diseases 

------------------------------
Slide 5
Introduction 


Understanding the molecular nature of mutations is a deeply compelling area of research. 
Since mutations can be quite harmful, organisms have developed ways to repair damaged DNA 

------------------------------
Slide 6
Genetic material can be changed through a number of ways 


Spontaneous changes 
Error in the replication process 
Actions of particular chemicals or radiation 


Two types of changes: 
Involving the whole chromosome 
Involving one or a few base pairs 


Base pair changes can be repaired by all organisms 

------------------------------
Slide 7
Mutation in protein coding region 
alters the protein structure. 
[img7]

Note: 
 Not all mutations lead to altered proteins. 
 Not all mutations are in protein coding regions. 

------------------------------
Slide 8
Mutations Defined 
A Mutation is the process by which a DNA base-pair or a chromosomal change is produced. 


Somatic Mutations: 
Mutant cell gives rise only to somatic cells.  
Mutation is not passed on to offspring. 


Germ-line mutation: 
Mutation in germline (egg or sperm precursors) 
Mutation is passed on to offspring. 


A mutation within a protein coding region is called a 
Gene Mutation 

------------------------------
Slide 9
Gene Mutations 


Gene mutations are molecular changes in the DNA sequence of a gene 
A  
point mutation 
 is a change in a single base pair 
It can involve a  
base substitution

A  
transition 
 is an interchange of a pyrimidine (C, T) or purine (A, G), which involves bases of similar shape 
A transversion 
 is an interchange between pyrimidines and purines, which involves exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures or vice versa. 
Transitions are more common than  
Transversions

Slide 12
Gene Mutations Outside of Coding Sequences 


Gene mutations outside of coding sequences can still affect phenotype 
Mutations in the core promoter can change levels of gene expression; it can either  
Up promoter =>mutations 
 increase expression. 
or 
Down promoter =>mutations 
 decrease expression 

------------------------------
Slide 13
Gene Mutations Outside of Coding Sequences 


TABLE 19.2 
Possible Consequences of Gene Mutations Outside of a Coding Sequence 

------------------------------
Slide 14
Mutations Based on Their Effects on Wild-Type Phenotype 


Mutations can also be described based on their effects on the wild-type phenotype 
They are often characterized by their differential ability to survive 
Deleterious mutations 
 decrease the chances of survival 
The most extreme are  
lethal mutations 
Beneficial mutations 
 enhance the survival or reproductive success of an organism 
The environment can affect whether a given mutation is deleterious or beneficial 
Some mutations are  
conditional 
They affect the phenotype only under a defined set of conditions 
An example is a temperature-sensitive mutation 

------------------------------
Slide 15
  
Forward mutation – mutation that changes wild type to 			  mutant 
 Reverse mutation (reversion or back mutations) 
	 
	Mutant to wild type: 
True reversion:    Back to wild type amino acid 
Partial reversion: Back to another amino acid, 			        	    with the Restoration of function 


  
Suppressor mutation: diminish or abolish the effects of a mutation 
 Mutation at a different position than the original mutation 
 No reversal of original mutation  


Direction of Mutation Impact 

------------------------------
Slide 16
Two types of suppressor mutations 
Intragenic and intergenic suppressors 


  
Intragenic suppressors: 
 Same gene as original mutation 
 Alter a nucleotide in the same codon 
		wild type     	CGU 		Arg 
		mutation	AGU		Ser 
		suppressor	AGA		Arg 
 Or in a different codon 
 Protein functional or partially functional 
  
Intergenic suppressors:   
Suppression of a mutational defect by 				a second mutation in another gene. 
 Functional or partially functional protein 

------------------------------
Slide 17
Suppressor Mutations 


TABLE 19.3 
Examples of Suppressor Mutations 
Type:  
Intragenic

Transport can occur 

------------------------------
Slide 18
Suppressor Mutations 


First Mutation (x) 
[img18]

Transport inhibited 


Second Mutation (x) 
[img18]

Transport can occur 


Description 
A first mutation disrupts normal protein function, and a suppressor mutation affecting the same protein restores function. In this example, the first mutation inhibits transport function, and the second mutation restores it. 

------------------------------
Slide 19
Changes in Chromosome Structure Can Affect Gene Expression 


A chromosomal rearrangement may affect a gene because the chromosomal  
breakpoint 
 (site of breaking and rejoining) occurs within the gene 
A gene may be left intact, but its expression may be altered because of its new location 
This is termed a  
position effect 
	 
There are two common reasons for position effects: 
1.  Movement to a position next to regulatory sequences 
2.  Movement to a heterochromatic region 
			       
For Example 

------------------------------
Slide 20
1) Position Effect Due to movement next to a Regulatory Sequences 
[img20]

(a) 
  
Position effect due to regulatory sequences 
Regulatory sequences are often bidirectional, so gene A may now show the expression pattern of gene B 
Figure 19.2a 

------------------------------
Slide 21
2) Movement by Translocation to Heterochromatic Region Reduces Expression of Eye Color Gene 
[img21]

(b) 
  
Position effects due to translocation to a heterochromatic chromosome 

------------------------------
Slide 22
Mutations can Occur in Germ-Line or Somatic Cells 


Geneticists classify animal cells into two types 
Germ-line cells 
Cells that give rise to gametes such as eggs and sperm 
Somatic cells 
All other cells 
Germ-line mutations 
 are those that occur directly in a sperm or egg cell, or in one of their precursor cells 
Somatic mutations 
 are those that occur directly in a body cell, or in one of its precursor cells 

------------------------------
Slide 23
Effects of Germ-line and Somatic Mutations 


Germ-line mutations  
occur in gametes 
Passed to half of the gametes in the next generation 
Patches of affected area are found after  
somatic mutation 
The size of the patch will depend on the timing of the mutation. The earlier the mutation, the larger the patch 
An individual with somatic regions that are genotypically different from is called a  
genetic mosaic 
Mutations not present in gametes 

------------------------------
Slide 24
Examples of  
Effects of Germ-line and Somatic Mutations 
[img24]
------------------------------
Slide 25
Causes of Mutations 


Spontaneous: 
  
	Occur naturally 
Error in cellular processing (e.g., DNA replication) 
Mutagen in the environment (e.g., UV irradiation) 


Induced:  
	Unnatural 
Treatment with a known chemical or physical mutagen 

------------------------------
[img26]Slide 26
Spontaneous mutations can result from errors in DNA replication or 
spontaneous chemical changes in DNA. 


DNA replication:  Point mutations, 
Additions, and deletions. 
Base pair substitutions: 
	 
     Mismatch base pairs. 
    Mismatching is due to  
   “wobble” pairing of bases. 
Spatial positioning of bases allows for the formation of hydrogen bonds between mismatched pairs. 
If uncorrected before replication, mutation can become fixed as a mutant.

Slide 29
Causes of Spontaneous Mutations 


Spontaneous mutations can arise by three types of chemical changes 
	1. 	 
Depurination 
	2. 	Deamination 
	3. 	Tautomeric shift 

------------------------------
Slide 30
Spontaneous Chemical Changes 


Depurination:   
Purine base for A or G is removed from  
	DNA, i.e, base is lost but the deoxyribose is retained. 
	1000’s of purines are lost per generation time of a  
	mammalian cell in tissue culture. 
	Fortunately, these apurinic sites can be repaired. 
	But, If not corrected, no complimentary base on strand.   
	A random base is then selected, which more likely 
	results in a mutation. 

------------------------------

Deamination 
 of cytosine to uracil (a); deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine 
[img32]

Deamination 
Small amount of 5-methylcytosine in cells 


Uracil is not in DNA. So, repair 
system removes most of the uracil. 
Minimal mutations:  If not  
repaired, adenine is in the  
new strand. 
No repair system, since thymine 
is a normal base in DNA. 
CG to TA transition occurs. 
This occurs at mutational  
Hotspots.

Deamination: Mutational Hotspots on lac repressor gene. 

------------------------------
Slide 34
Tautomeric Shift 


A temporary change in base structure 
The common, stable form of thymine and guanine is the  
keto 
 form 
Rarely, T and G convert to an  
enol 
 form 
The common, stable form of adenine and cytosine is the  
amino 
 form 
Rarely, A and C can convert to an  
imino 
 form 
[img34]
------------------------------
Slide 35
Tautomeric Shift 


These rare forms promote AC and GT base pairs 
[img35]

Mistakes in base pairing 

------------------------------
Slide 36
Tautomeric Shift 


To cause mutation, tautomeric shift must occur immediately prior to replication 
[img36]

Tautomeric shifts and DNA replication can cause mutation 

------------------------------
Slide 37
Induced Mutations 


Ionizing radiation:  
X-rays bombard atoms making ions. 
	This breaks chemical bonds in DNA and creates 
	chromosomal breakage, chromosomal rearrangements 
	and point mutations. 
	High doses of X-rays kills cells and 
	Low doses (certain levels) induce point mutations: 
		Two times amount of ionizing radiations induces 
		twice the amount of point mutations. 
	Therefore, the effects are cumulative. 
		A certain dose of ionizing radiation induces a 	 
		certain amount of point mutations, i.e., same dose 
		for short period of time or long period equal the 
		same number of point mutations. 
Always be concerned about the amount of X-rays  
your are exposed too.

Reed College Reactor 
[img37]

Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster 
Found 2-meter hole in the metal grating under the  
pressure vessel in the reactor’s primary  
containment vessel, which was caused by the fuel  
escaping the pressure vessel in a Nuclear meltdown.  
Radiation levels of about  
530 sieverts per hour!!!! 
have been detected in the containment vessel  
of reactor No. 2. 

------------------------------
Slide 38
How many Sieverts of Radiation will kill you? 


One Sievert equals 1,000 millisieverts (mSv). 	One millisievert is 1,000 microsieverts. 
Below are some facts about the health dangers posed by higher radiation levels: 
* People are exposed to natural radiation of 2-3 mSv a year. 
* In a CT scan, the organ being studied typically receives a radiation dose of 15 mSv in an adult to 30 mSv 	in a newborn infant. 
* A typical chest X-ray involves exposure of about 0.02 mSv, while a dental one can be 0.01 mSv. 
* Exposure to 100 mSv a year  
is the lowest level at which any increase in cancer risk is clearly evident.  
	A cumulative 1,000 mSv (1 sievert) would probably cause a fatal cancer many years  
	later in five out of every 100 persons exposed to it. 
***  
A single one Sievert ( 
1,000 mSv) dose causes radiation sickness such as nausea, vomiting, 	hemorrhaging, but not death. *** 
*** A single dose of 5 Sieverts would kill about half of those  
exposed to it within a month.****

Induced Mutations 




UV or ultraviolet radiation is not an ionizing radiation! 
	Induces mutations by inducing photochemical  
	changes in the DNA molecule.

The New England Journal of Medicine has published a shocking  
photo of a 69 year-old man with unilateral dermatoheliosis  
-- severe damage from ultraviolet rays on one side of his face. 
The unnamed man, who gave permission for his photo to be  
used in new stories, told researchers that he had driven a  
delivery truck for 28 years.Ultraviolet A (UVA) had penetrated  
the window glass, damaging  
the outermost layers and sublayers of his skin.

3) Alkylating 
     Agents 


Exposure of alkylating agents is at a minimum level in daily life. However, vegetables, drinking water, beer, tobacco, various drugs, processed cheese, meat and fish products contain a  
considerable amount of alkylating agents. Smoked and salted meat-fish consumption is found to be related with an increased risk of mouth, pharynx, esophagus, colon and gastric cancers 
.

Slide 44
Chemical Mutations 
Base Analogues (similar structure) can cause Mutations 


Become incorporated into daughter strands during DNA replication 
For example,  
5-bromouracil 
 is a thymine analogue 
It can be incorporated into DNA instead of thymine 
A tautomeric shift can result in pairing with guanine

Natural, Spontaneous Mutations 


All types of point mutations can occur spontaneously. 
Quantitative measurements of how often a spontaneous mutation occurs. 
Mutational rate:  Probability of particular kind of mutation  
	as function of time. 
		number per nucleotide per generation 
				or 
		number per gene per generation 
			10 
-4 
 to 10 
-5 
 per gene per generation 
Mutational Frequency:  Number of occurrences of a mutation  
	expressed as a proportion of cells or individuals in a population. 
		number per 100,000 organisms 
				or 
		number per 1,000,000 gametes 
	Note: 
	1)  Mutational rate is affected by genetic constitution of organism.  
	2)  Most spontaneous errors are corrected:  Only those fixed into 
		DNA are counted.
